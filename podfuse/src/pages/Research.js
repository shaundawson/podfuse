                            Podcasts have grown exponentially in the past decade, with platforms like
                            Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Patreon providing spaces for creators to thrive.
                            Premium, ad-free content on platforms such as Patreon has enabled podcasters
                            to directly connect with their audiences and monetize their work. However,
                            this surge in premium podcast availability has created complexities for listeners,
                            requiring manual feed management that disrupts the seamless experience users expect.

                                access premium and free podcast feeds, creating a disjointed experience.

                            PodFuse was built with a user-first approach. Research into listener habits,
                            frustrations, and expectations revealed the need for a single platform that
                            integrates premium podcast feeds seamlessly. Personas like "Nandi, the Podcast Addict"
                            and "Tracy, the Podcast Newbie" guided the development to address a wide range of user needs.
